# BLRRealEstateML

I'm excited to share I have completed a project on predicting house prices in Bengaluru using machine learning!

🔍 Project Highlights:

Data: We used real estate data from Bengaluru, including location, area, square footage, bedrooms, and amenities.
Techniques: We applied Linear Regression, Random Forest, K-Means, and DBSCAN clustering.
Tools: We handled missing values, outliers, and performed feature engineering to improve our model.
📊 Results:

Evaluation: We optimized our models using cross-validation and measured performance with metrics like R-squared and Mean Squared Error.
Visuals: Created scatter plots, histograms, and correlation matrices to understand our data and model predictions.
🌐 Website:
We built a full-stack website to provide accurate house price estimates in Bengaluru.

💡 Impact:
This project helps buyers, sellers, and investors make informed real estate decisions.
