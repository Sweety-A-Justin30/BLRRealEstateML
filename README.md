# BLRRealEstateML

I'm thrilled to share that I have successfully completed a comprehensive project on house price prediction, leveraging machine learning and data analysis to create a robust predictive model for house prices in Bengaluru.

🔍 Project Overview:
House price prediction plays a crucial role in real estate decision-making, aiding buyers, sellers, and investors in making informed choices. This project focuses on developing a predictive model for house prices in Bengaluru using advanced machine learning techniques and data analysis.

📊 Data & Methodology:

Dataset: We used a dataset comprising features such as location, area type, total square feet area, number of bedrooms, and other amenities collected from real estate listings in Bengaluru.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted to understand the distribution and relationships between variables.
Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values, outliers, and categorical variables.
Feature Engineering: Extracted meaningful insights to enhance the predictive power of the model.
🤖 Machine Learning Techniques:

Algorithms: Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, K-Means Clustering, and DBSCAN Clustering.
Model Optimization: Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation to optimize performance.
Evaluation Metrics: K-fold cross-validation, R-squared score, Mean Squared Error, Confusion Matrix, Accuracy, Silhouette Coefficient, and Davies-Bouldin Index.
📈 Visualization & Insights:
Utilized scatter plots, count plots, violin plots, histograms, and correlation matrices to interpret model predictions and gain actionable insights.

🌐 Full Stack Website:
We developed a full-stack website that serves as a valuable tool for stakeholders in the Bengaluru real estate market, providing accurate estimates of house prices based on relevant features.

💡 Impact:
This project contributes to the advancement of housing market analysis and decision-making processes, facilitating informed choices and enhancing overall market transparency.
